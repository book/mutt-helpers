# mutt-helpers

This repository contains some helper scripts I use with
[Mutt](http://mutt.org) Mail User-Agent.

* **mutt-cmd-gen** is used to generate Mutt commands from an email
* **mutt-ezmlm** is used to download email archives from ezmlm-managed
  newsgroups (see <https://www.nntp.perl.org> for an example)
  and save them in a Maildir
